Why 90% of “DevOps Engineers” Can’t Debug a Simple Server Issue

Every week I see someone with “3 years DevOps experience” who can deploy to Kubernetes but freezes when asked to troubleshoot why a server is running slow.

They know every Terraform module by heart but can’t explain why their application randomly crashes at 2 AM.

❎DevOps isn’t Docker commands and YAML files.

✅It’s understanding systems at a fundamental level before you automate them.

👉The Foundation Most People Skip:

→ How DNS actually resolves and why your service discovery fails
→ Reading system metrics: CPU, memory, disk I/O, and what they mean for performance
→ Network fundamentals: why packets drop, routing basics, port conflicts
→ The complete journey of a web request from browser to database
→ Firewall rules: stateful vs stateless and why your containers can’t talk
→ Linux process management: why your service won’t start and how to fix it
→ System debugging: finding bottlenecks without fancy monitoring tools
→ File permissions and user management that break deployments

👉The Problem with Tool-First Learning:

- You learn Kubernetes before understanding how containers actually work.
- You write Ansible playbooks without knowing what they’re configuring.
- You deploy microservices but can’t diagnose why they’re slow.
- You set up monitoring but don’t understand what metrics matter.

👉Real DevOps engineers think like this:

“The application is slow. Let me check CPU usage, then memory, then disk I/O. Now let me trace the network path and check database connections. Found it - the disk is at 95% and swap is thrashing.”

❌Not like this:
“The application is slow. Let me restart the pods and see if that fixes it.”

→ Before you automate infrastructure, you need to understand what you’re automating.

→ Before you monitor systems, you need to know what healthy systems look like.

→ Before you deploy at scale, you need to debug problems at the system level.

👉The tools are just multipliers of your fundamental knowledge.

If you can’t troubleshoot a single Linux server, how will you manage hundreds of them?
