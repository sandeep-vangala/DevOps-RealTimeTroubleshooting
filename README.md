### 1\. Jenkins Master Fails to Start

  * **Issue:** Jenkins Master fails to start.

  * **Resolution:**

      * **Step 1:** Check Jenkins logs located at `/var/log/jenkins/jenkins.log`.
      * **Step 2:** Look for error messages indicating startup failures.
      * **Step 3:** Resolve common issues like port conflicts, insufficient permissions, or corrupted configurations.
      * **Step 4:** Restart Jenkins.

    <!-- end list -->

    ```bash
    sudo tail -f /var/log/jenkins/jenkins.log
    ```

-----

### 2\. Out of Memory Error

  * **Issue:** Jenkins encounters an Out of Memory error.

  * **Resolution:**

      * **Step 1:** Increase the Java heap space allocated to Jenkins.
      * **Step 2:** Edit the Jenkins startup script or configuration file to set the `JAVA_ARGS` parameter with a higher heap size, e.g., `-Xmx2g`.
      * **Step 3:** Monitor system resources to ensure sufficient RAM is available.

    <!-- end list -->

    ```bash
    # In Jenkins startup script or configuration file (e.g., /etc/default/jenkins or /etc/sysconfig/jenkins)
    JAVA_ARGS="-Xmx2g -Dhudson.model.DirectoryBrowserSupport.CSP=\"sandbox allow-scripts; default-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';\""
    # Note: The CSP part is often added to allow certain inline styles/scripts if issues arise with UI
    ```

-----

### 3\. Plugin Compatibility

  * **Issue:** Plugin compatibility issues.

  * **Resolution:**

      * **Step 1:** Check Jenkins plugin versions for compatibility with the Jenkins master version. Refer to the Jenkins plugin site or changelogs.
      * **Step 2:** Update plugins to versions compatible with your Jenkins master. This can often be done via the Jenkins UI (Manage Jenkins \> Manage Plugins \> Updates tab). If the UI is inaccessible, manually remove/downgrade the problematic plugin JAR from `/var/lib/jenkins/plugins/`.

    <!-- end list -->

    ```bash
    # If the UI is inaccessible, you might need to restart after manual plugin removal
    sudo systemctl restart jenkins
    ```

-----

### 4\. Disk Space Exhaustion

  * **Issue:** Disk space exhaustion on the server hosting Jenkins.

  * **Resolution:**

      * **Step 1:** Inspect disk space on the server hosting Jenkins.
      * **Step 2:** Clean up unnecessary files, old build logs, and artifacts within the Jenkins home directory (`/var/lib/jenkins/`). Configure job retention policies.
      * **Step 3:** Consider expanding the disk space if continuous exhaustion occurs.

    <!-- end list -->

    ```bash
    # Check disk space usage
    df -h

    # Clean up Jenkins workspace (be cautious, this deletes build history/data)
    sudo rm -rf /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/*

    # Clean up old Jenkins logs (adjust retention as needed)
    sudo find /var/log/jenkins/ -type f -mtime +7 -delete
    ```

-----

### 5\. Corrupted Configuration Files

  * **Issue:** Corrupted configuration files (e.g., `config.xml`).

  * **Resolution:**

      * **Step 1:** Review Jenkins configuration files, such as `/var/lib/jenkins/config.xml` or job-specific `config.xml` files.
      * **Step 2:** Manually inspect for malformed XML or restore from a backup if corruption is detected.
      * **Step 3:** Ensure proper XML syntax and configuration settings.

    <!-- end list -->

    ```bash
    # Manually inspect the main Jenkins configuration file
    sudo nano /var/lib/jenkins/config.xml

    # If you have a backup, restore it (replace with your actual backup path)
    sudo cp /backup/jenkins/config.xml /var/lib/jenkins/config.xml

    # After restoring/editing, restart Jenkins for changes to take effect
    sudo systemctl restart jenkins
    ```

-----

### 6\. Database Connection Problems

  * **Issue:** Database connection problems (if Jenkins uses an external database, or its internal H2 database).

  * **Resolution:**

      * **Step 1:** Verify the database connection settings in Jenkins configurations (e.g., in a `jenkins.dbconfig` file or specific plugin configurations if using an external DB).
      * **Step 2:** Check the database server itself for issues (is it running, reachable, firewall rules, user permissions).
      * **Step 3:** Repair or reconfigure the database connection settings in Jenkins if necessary.

    <!-- end list -->

    ```bash
    # Verify Jenkins' database configuration (path may vary depending on setup)
    sudo nano /var/lib/jenkins/jenkins.dbconfig # Or other relevant config files

    # Check status of a common database server (e.g., MySQL)
    sudo systemctl status mysql
    # Or for PostgreSQL
    sudo systemctl status postgresql
    ```

-----

### 7\. Java Compatibility

  * **Issue:** Java compatibility issues.

  * **Resolution:**

      * **Step 1:** Ensure Jenkins is using a supported version of Java. Check the official Jenkins documentation for current compatibility matrix.
      * **Step 2:** Verify the Java version currently being used by the Jenkins process.
      * **Step 3:** Update Java if needed and restart Jenkins.

    <!-- end list -->

    ```bash
    # Check current Java version
    java -version

    # If an update is needed (example for OpenJDK 11 on Debian/Ubuntu)
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk
    sudo update-alternatives --config java # Select the desired Java version if multiple are installed

    # Restart Jenkins after Java changes
    sudo systemctl restart jenkins
    ```

-----

### 8\. Permission Problems

  * **Issue:** Jenkins process lacks necessary permissions to access files, directories, or resources.

  * **Resolution:**

      * **Step 1:** Verify that the Jenkins process (usually running as the `jenkins` user) has the necessary read, write, and execute permissions for its home directory (`/var/lib/jenkins/`), plugin directory, and any directories it interacts with for builds.
      * **Step 2:** Ensure proper ownership and permissions for Jenkins files and directories.

    <!-- end list -->

    ```bash
    # Verify and set proper ownership for the Jenkins home directory
    sudo chown -R jenkins:jenkins /var/lib/jenkins

    # Set appropriate permissions (e.g., 755 for directories, 644 for files, adjust as needed)
    sudo find /var/lib/jenkins/ -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;
    sudo find /var/lib/jenkins/ -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;

    # If Jenkins needs to access other specific directories, ensure they have correct permissions
    # Example: Build agent workspaces, source code repositories, etc.
    ```

### 9\. Overloaded Jenkins Master

  * **Issue:** Jenkins Master becomes unresponsive or very slow due to excessive load.

  * **Resolution:**

      * **Step 1:** **Monitor Resource Utilization:** Check CPU, memory, and I/O usage on the Jenkins master server using tools like `top`, `htop`, `iostat`, `vmstat`.
      * **Step 2:** **Review Build Queue:** Check the Jenkins UI to see the number of jobs in the build queue. A long queue indicates a bottleneck.
      * **Step 3:** **Optimize Jobs:**
          * Reduce the frequency of polling SCM.
          * Optimize build scripts to be more efficient.
          * Disable unnecessary plugins.
      * **Step 4:** **Scale Out with Agents:** The most common solution is to offload build execution to Jenkins agents (nodes). This distributes the workload and reduces the burden on the master.
      * **Step 5:** **Adjust Concurrent Builds:** Limit the number of concurrent builds on the master (if any are allowed) and on agents.
      * **Step 6:** **Garbage Collection Tuning:** If Java heap usage is consistently high, fine-tune JVM garbage collection settings in `JAVA_ARGS`.
      * **Step 7:** **Upgrade Hardware:** As a last resort, if software optimizations and scaling out agents aren't enough, consider upgrading the master's hardware resources.

    <!-- end list -->

    ```bash
    # Check current system resource usage
    top
    df -h
    free -h

    # To check the Jenkins build queue (via Jenkins Script Console, Manage Jenkins -> Script Console)
    # println Jenkins.instance.queue.items.size()
    ```

-----

# Verify and set proper permissions
sudo chown -R jenkins:jenkins /var/lib/jenkins
sudo chmod -R 755 /var/lib/jenkins
