What is Amazon EKS, and how does it differ from self-managed Kubernetes?
Why Asked: Tests foundational knowledge of EKS and its managed benefits.
Answer: Amazon EKS is a managed Kubernetes service that simplifies cluster management by handling the control plane (API server, etcd). 
Unlike self-managed Kubernetes, where you manage all components (master and worker nodes), EKS automates control plane scaling, upgrades, and high availability across multiple Availability Zones (AZs). 
You still manage worker nodes (e.g., via EC2 or Fargate). EKS integrates with AWS services like ALB, IAM, and CloudWatch for seamless operations.
Key Points: Managed control plane, multi-AZ, AWS integrations, worker node flexibility.
What are the key components of an EKS cluster?
Why Asked: Assesses understanding of EKS architecture.
Answer: An EKS cluster consists of:
Control Plane: Managed by AWS, includes the Kubernetes API server, scheduler, controller manager, and etcd, running across multiple AZs.
Worker Nodes: EC2 instances or Fargate pods running the kubelet and kube-proxy, hosting application pods.
VPC: The cluster’s network, with subnets for control plane and worker nodes.
IAM Roles: For cluster authentication (e.g., aws-iam-authenticator) and pod permissions (IRSA).
Add-ons: EKS supports add-ons like CoreDNS, kube-proxy, and VPC-CNI for networking.
Key Points: Control plane vs. worker nodes, VPC integration, IAM for auth.
How do you deploy an application to an EKS cluster?
Why Asked: Evaluates practical knowledge of deployment workflows.
Answer: Deploying an application to EKS involves:
Build Docker Image: Use a CI tool like Jenkins to build and push the image to Amazon ECR.
Create Kubernetes Manifests: Define deployments, services, and ingresses in YAML (e.g., Deployment for pods, Service for internal load balancing, Ingress for ALB).
Authenticate to EKS: Configure kubectl with the cluster’s kubeconfig (generated via aws eks update-kubeconfig).
Apply Manifests: Run kubectl apply -f manifest.yaml to deploy resources.
CI/CD Integration: Use Jenkins to automate the pipeline, triggering builds on code commits, pushing images to ECR, and applying manifests to EKS.
Verify Deployment: Check pod status (kubectl get pods) and test the application endpoint.
Key Points: Docker, ECR, Kubernetes manifests, Jenkins pipeline, kubectl.
What AWS services are typically involved in an EKS-based application deployment?
Why Asked: Tests understanding of the AWS ecosystem with EKS.
Answer: Key services include:
ECR: Stores Docker images.
ALB/NLB: Routes external traffic to the EKS cluster.
ACM: Provides TLS certificates for HTTPS.
Secrets Manager: Stores sensitive data like database credentials or certificate ARNs.
CloudWatch: Monitors cluster and application metrics/logs.
IAM: Manages authentication and authorization (e.g., IRSA for pod permissions).
Route 53: Resolves DNS for the application (e.g., app.example.com).
EKS: Runs the Kubernetes cluster.
Jenkins: Orchestrates CI/CD pipelines.
Key Points: Ecosystem integration, service roles, automation.
Intermediate-Level Questions
How does an ALB integrate with an EKS cluster to route traffic to an application?
Why Asked: Assesses knowledge of networking and ingress in EKS.
Answer: The ALB integrates with EKS via the AWS ALB Ingress Controller:
Ingress Controller: A Kubernetes pod running in the EKS cluster (deployed as a Deployment) that manages ALB configurations.
Ingress Resource: A Kubernetes Ingress object defines routing rules (e.g., path-based routing to /api or /web).
Annotations: The Ingress uses annotations like alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/scheme (internet-facing or internal) and alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/certificate-arn to attach an ACM certificate.
Service: The Ingress targets a Kubernetes Service (type ClusterIP or NodePort), which routes to application pods.
Flow: User traffic hits the ALB, which uses listener rules to route to target groups. The ALB Ingress Controller configures these target groups to point to EKS worker node IPs or pod IPs.
Key Points: ALB Ingress Controller, Ingress resource, annotations, target groups.
Explain the end-to-end flow of a user request hitting an ALB and reaching the application endpoint in EKS.
Why Asked: Tests deep understanding of networking and request flow in EKS.
Answer: The flow involves:
User Request: A user accesses https://app.example.com via a browser.
Route 53: Resolves app.example.com to the ALB’s DNS name.
ALB: The ALB receives the request, terminates TLS (using an ACM certificate), and evaluates listener rules (e.g., path /api).
Target Group: The ALB forwards the request to a target group, which points to EKS worker nodes or pods (configured by the ALB Ingress Controller).
EKS Worker Nodes: The request reaches the worker node’s kube-proxy via a NodePort or pod IP.
Kubernetes Service: Kube-proxy routes the request to a Service (e.g., ClusterIP), which load-balances to application pods.
Application Pod: The pod (running the application container) processes the request and sends a response back through the same path.
Response: The ALB returns the response to the user.
Key Services: Route 53, ALB, ACM, EKS, ALB Ingress Controller, Kubernetes Service and Ingress.
Key Points: DNS resolution, TLS termination, ingress routing, pod communication.
How do you secure an EKS cluster for production deployments?
Why Asked: Evaluates knowledge of security best practices.
Answer: Securing an EKS cluster involves:
IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA): Assign fine-grained IAM roles to pods for AWS resource access.
Network Policies: Use Kubernetes NetworkPolicy to restrict pod-to-pod traffic (e.g., via Calico).
VPC Security: Place EKS in a private VPC subnet with security groups to limit access.
RBAC: Configure Kubernetes Role-Based Access Control to restrict user and pod permissions.
Secrets Management: Store sensitive data in Secrets Manager and inject into pods via Kubernetes secrets.
TLS: Use ACM for ALB certificates and enforce HTTPS.
Logging/Monitoring: Enable CloudWatch Logs and Metrics for cluster and application monitoring.
Cluster Upgrades: Regularly update EKS control plane and worker nodes.
Key Points: IRSA, network policies, RBAC, Secrets Manager, monitoring.
How do you integrate Jenkins with EKS for CI/CD?
Why Asked: Tests CI/CD pipeline knowledge in the context of EKS.
Answer: Jenkins integrates with EKS as follows:
Jenkins Pipeline: Define a pipeline in Jenkins (e.g., using a Jenkinsfile).
Build Stage: Build the application, create a Docker image, and push it to Amazon ECR using docker build and aws ecr get-login-password.
Deploy Stage: Use the AWS CLI or kubectl plugin in Jenkins to authenticate to EKS (via aws eks update-kubeconfig) and apply Kubernetes manifests (kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml).
Plugins: Use Jenkins plugins like AWS SDK, Docker, or Kubernetes CLI.
IAM Credentials: Jenkins uses an IAM role or access keys with permissions for ECR and EKS.
Testing: Run tests post-build and pre-deployment (e.g., unit tests or integration tests).
Rollback: Implement rollback strategies (e.g., kubectl rollout undo).
Key Points: Jenkins pipeline, ECR, kubectl, IAM, testing.
Advanced-Level Questions
How do you handle blue-green or canary deployments in EKS?
Why Asked: Assesses advanced deployment strategies for zero-downtime releases.
Answer: For blue-green or canary deployments:
Blue-Green:
Deploy a new version of the application as a separate Deployment (e.g., app-v2).
Create a new Service or update the existing Service selector to point to app-v2 pods.
Use the ALB Ingress Controller to route traffic to the new Service after validation.
Delete the old Deployment (app-v1) post-switch.
Canary:
Deploy the new version with a small percentage of traffic (e.g., 10%) using an Ingress with weighted target groups (via ALB annotations like alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/traffic-distribution).
Monitor metrics (e.g., CloudWatch or Prometheus) to validate the new version.
Gradually increase traffic to the new version or roll back if issues occur.
Tools: Use Helm for templating, ArgoCD for GitOps, or Jenkins for automation.
EKS Features: Leverage EKS Fargate for serverless scaling or node groups for precise control.
Key Points: Blue-green vs. canary, ALB weights, monitoring, Helm/ArgoCD.
What challenges might you face when deploying applications to EKS in production, and how do you address them?
Why Asked: Tests problem-solving and operational expertise.
Answer: Common challenges and solutions:
Challenge: Cluster autoscaling issues (e.g., pods stuck in Pending).
Solution: Use Cluster Autoscaler to scale node groups based on pod demand. Configure Pod Disruption Budgets (PDBs) to ensure availability.
Challenge: Networking misconfigurations (e.g., ALB not routing to pods).
Solution: Validate Ingress annotations, security groups, and VPC CNI settings. Use kubectl logs on the ALB Ingress Controller.
Challenge: Secret management (e.g., exposing sensitive data).
Solution: Use Secrets Manager with IRSA to securely inject secrets into pods.
Challenge: Downtime during deployments.
Solution: Implement blue-green or canary deployments and use readiness probes.
Challenge: Monitoring and debugging.
Solution: Integrate Prometheus/Grafana for metrics and CloudWatch for logs.
Key Points: Autoscaling, networking, secrets, zero-downtime, monitoring.
End-to-End Request Flow (Detailed)
To address your specific request about the flow from a user hitting the ALB to the application endpoint, here’s a detailed breakdown:

User Request:
A user sends an HTTPS request to https://app.example.com/api.
The domain resolves via Route 53 to the ALB’s DNS name.
Route 53:
Hosted zone in Route 53 maps app.example.com to the ALB’s DNS (e.g., alb-123456.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com).
Application Load Balancer (ALB):
The ALB listens on port 443 (HTTPS) with an ACM certificate for TLS termination.
Listener rules evaluate the request path (e.g., /api) and route to a target group.
The target group is configured by the ALB Ingress Controller to point to EKS worker nodes or pod IPs.
EKS Cluster:
Worker Nodes: The request reaches a worker node (EC2 or Fargate) via a NodePort (if using Service type NodePort) or pod IP (if using AWS VPC CNI).
Kube-Proxy: Routes the request to a Kubernetes Service (type ClusterIP), which load-balances to application pods.
Ingress Controller: The AWS ALB Ingress Controller (running as a pod) syncs the ALB’s target group with the Service and pod IPs.
Kubernetes Service:
The Service selects pods based on labels (e.g., app: my-app).
Routes traffic to a healthy pod (based on readiness probes).
Application Pod:
The pod runs the application container (e.g., a Node.js app).
Processes the request and returns a response (e.g., JSON data).
Response Path:
The response travels back through the Service, kube-proxy, worker node, ALB, and to the user.
Monitoring:
CloudWatch logs ALB access logs and application logs.
Prometheus/Grafana (if deployed) monitors pod metrics.
Services Involved:

Route 53: DNS resolution.
ACM: TLS certificate for the ALB.
ALB: External load balancing and TLS termination.
EKS: Kubernetes cluster hosting the application.
ALB Ingress Controller: Syncs ALB with Kubernetes Ingress.
CloudWatch: Logs and metrics.
Secrets Manager: Stores sensitive data (e.g., certificate ARNs, database credentials).
ECR: Stores Docker images for the application.
Jenkins: Automates deployment to EKS.
