# Amazon EKS Interview Preparation Guide

This guide covers foundational, intermediate, and advanced questions about Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), including common deployment scenarios and best practices.

-----

## Foundational Knowledge

### What is Amazon EKS, and how does it differ from self-managed Kubernetes?

**Amazon EKS** is a **managed Kubernetes service** that simplifies cluster management by handling the **control plane** (API server, etcd). Unlike **self-managed Kubernetes**, where you manage all components (master and worker nodes), EKS automates control plane scaling, upgrades, and high availability across multiple Availability Zones (AZs). You still manage worker nodes (e.g., via EC2 or Fargate). EKS integrates seamlessly with AWS services like ALB, IAM, and CloudWatch for streamlined operations.

**Key Points:**

  * **Managed control plane**
  * **Multi-AZ** for high availability
  * **AWS integrations**
  * **Worker node flexibility**

-----

### What are the key components of an EKS cluster?

An EKS cluster consists of:

  * **Control Plane:** Managed by AWS, includes the Kubernetes API server, scheduler, controller manager, and etcd, running across multiple AZs.
  * **Worker Nodes:** EC2 instances or Fargate pods running the kubelet and kube-proxy, hosting application pods.
  * **VPC:** The cluster’s network, with subnets for control plane and worker nodes.
  * **IAM Roles:** For cluster authentication (e.g., `aws-iam-authenticator`) and pod permissions (IRSA).
  * **Add-ons:** EKS supports add-ons like CoreDNS, kube-proxy, and VPC-CNI for networking.

**Key Points:**

  * **Control plane vs. worker nodes**
  * **VPC integration**
  * **IAM for authentication and authorization**

-----

### How do you deploy an application to an EKS cluster?

Deploying an application to EKS involves:

1.  **Build Docker Image:** Use a CI tool (like Jenkins) to build and push the image to **Amazon ECR**.
2.  **Create Kubernetes Manifests:** Define deployments, services, and ingresses in YAML (e.g., `Deployment` for pods, `Service` for internal load balancing, `Ingress` for ALB).
3.  **Authenticate to EKS:** Configure `kubectl` with the cluster’s kubeconfig (generated via `aws eks update-kubeconfig`).
4.  **Apply Manifests:** Run `kubectl apply -f manifest.yaml` to deploy resources.
5.  **CI/CD Integration:** Use Jenkins to automate the pipeline, triggering builds on code commits, pushing images to ECR, and applying manifests to EKS.
6.  **Verify Deployment:** Check pod status (`kubectl get pods`) and test the application endpoint.

**Key Points:**

  * **Docker and ECR**
  * **Kubernetes manifests**
  * **Jenkins pipeline for automation**
  * `kubectl` for cluster interaction

-----

### What AWS services are typically involved in an EKS-based application deployment?

Key services include:

  * **ECR:** Stores Docker images.
  * **ALB/NLB:** Routes external traffic to the EKS cluster.
  * **ACM:** Provides TLS certificates for HTTPS.
  * **Secrets Manager:** Stores sensitive data like database credentials or certificate ARNs.
  * **CloudWatch:** Monitors cluster and application metrics/logs.
  * **IAM:** Manages authentication and authorization (e.g., IRSA for pod permissions).
  * **Route 53:** Resolves DNS for the application (e.g., `app.example.com`).
  * **EKS:** Runs the Kubernetes cluster.
  * **Jenkins:** Orchestrates CI/CD pipelines.

**Key Points:**

  * **Ecosystem integration**
  * **Service roles for various functionalities**
  * **Automation capabilities**

-----

## Intermediate-Level Questions

### How does an ALB integrate with an EKS cluster to route traffic to an application?

The ALB integrates with EKS via the **AWS ALB Ingress Controller**:

  * **Ingress Controller:** A Kubernetes pod running in the EKS cluster (deployed as a `Deployment`) that manages ALB configurations.
  * **Ingress Resource:** A Kubernetes `Ingress` object defines routing rules (e.g., path-based routing to `/api` or `/web`).
  * **Annotations:** The `Ingress` uses annotations like `alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/scheme` (internet-facing or internal) and `alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/certificate-arn` to attach an ACM certificate.
  * **Service:** The `Ingress` targets a Kubernetes `Service` (type `ClusterIP` or `NodePort`), which routes to application pods.
  * **Flow:** User traffic hits the ALB, which uses listener rules to route to target groups. The ALB Ingress Controller configures these target groups to point to EKS worker node IPs or pod IPs.

**Key Points:**

  * **ALB Ingress Controller**
  * **Ingress resource for routing rules**
  * **Annotations for ALB configuration**
  * **Target groups integration**

-----

### Explain the end-to-end flow of a user request hitting an ALB and reaching the application endpoint in EKS.

The flow involves:

1.  **User Request:** A user accesses `https://app.example.com` via a browser.
2.  **Route 53:** Resolves `app.example.com` to the ALB’s DNS name.
3.  **ALB:** The ALB receives the request, terminates TLS (using an ACM certificate), and evaluates listener rules (e.g., path `/api`).
4.  **Target Group:** The ALB forwards the request to a target group, which points to EKS worker nodes or pods (configured by the ALB Ingress Controller).
5.  **EKS Worker Nodes:** The request reaches the worker node’s `kube-proxy` via a `NodePort` or pod IP.
6.  **Kubernetes Service:** `Kube-proxy` routes the request to a `Service` (e.g., `ClusterIP`), which load-balances to application pods.
7.  **Application Pod:** The pod (running the application container) processes the request and sends a response back through the same path.
8.  **Response:** The ALB returns the response to the user.

**Key Services:**

  * Route 53
  * ALB
  * ACM
  * EKS
  * ALB Ingress Controller
  * Kubernetes Service and Ingress

**Key Points:**

  * **DNS resolution**
  * **TLS termination at the ALB**
  * **Ingress routing rules**
  * **Pod communication via Kubernetes services**

-----

### How do you secure an EKS cluster for production deployments?

Securing an EKS cluster involves:

  * **IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA):** Assign fine-grained IAM roles to pods for AWS resource access.
  * **Network Policies:** Use Kubernetes `NetworkPolicy` to restrict pod-to-pod traffic (e.g., via Calico).
  * **VPC Security:** Place EKS in a private VPC subnet with security groups to limit access.
  * **RBAC:** Configure Kubernetes Role-Based Access Control to restrict user and pod permissions.
  * **Secrets Management:** Store sensitive data in **Secrets Manager** and inject into pods via Kubernetes secrets.
  * **TLS:** Use ACM for ALB certificates and enforce HTTPS.
  * **Logging/Monitoring:** Enable CloudWatch Logs and Metrics for cluster and application monitoring.
  * **Cluster Upgrades:** Regularly update EKS control plane and worker nodes.

**Key Points:**

  * **IRSA for least privilege**
  * **Network policies for traffic control**
  * **RBAC for access control**
  * **Secure secrets management**
  * **Comprehensive monitoring and logging**

-----

### How do you integrate Jenkins with EKS for CI/CD?

Jenkins integrates with EKS as follows:

  * **Jenkins Pipeline:** Define a pipeline in Jenkins (e.g., using a `Jenkinsfile`).
  * **Build Stage:** Build the application, create a Docker image, and push it to **Amazon ECR** using `docker build` and `aws ecr get-login-password`.
  * **Deploy Stage:** Use the AWS CLI or `kubectl` plugin in Jenkins to authenticate to EKS (via `aws eks update-kubeconfig`) and apply Kubernetes manifests (`kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml`).
  * **Plugins:** Use Jenkins plugins like AWS SDK, Docker, or Kubernetes CLI.
  * **IAM Credentials:** Jenkins uses an IAM role or access keys with permissions for ECR and EKS.
  * **Testing:** Run tests post-build and pre-deployment (e.g., unit tests or integration tests).
  * **Rollback:** Implement rollback strategies (e.g., `kubectl rollout undo`).

**Key Points:**

  * **Jenkins pipeline automation**
  * **ECR for image management**
  * `kubectl` for deployments
  * **IAM for secure access**
  * **Testing and rollback capabilities**

-----

## Advanced-Level Questions

### How do you handle blue-green or canary deployments in EKS?

For blue-green or canary deployments:

  * **Blue-Green:**

      * Deploy a new version of the application as a separate `Deployment` (e.g., `app-v2`).
      * Create a new `Service` or update the existing `Service` selector to point to `app-v2` pods.
      * Use the ALB Ingress Controller to route traffic to the new `Service` after validation.
      * Delete the old `Deployment` (`app-v1`) post-switch.

  * **Canary:**

      * Deploy the new version with a small percentage of traffic (e.g., 10%) using an `Ingress` with weighted target groups (via ALB annotations like `alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/traffic-distribution`).
      * Monitor metrics (e.g., CloudWatch or Prometheus) to validate the new version.
      * Gradually increase traffic to the new version or roll back if issues occur.

**Tools:**

  * Use **Helm** for templating
  * **ArgoCD** for GitOps
  * **Jenkins** for automation

**EKS Features:**

  * Leverage EKS Fargate for serverless scaling
  * Node groups for precise control

**Key Points:**

  * **Blue-green vs. canary strategies**
  * **ALB weights for canary deployments**
  * **Continuous monitoring for validation**
  * **Utilizing tools like Helm and ArgoCD**

-----

### What challenges might you face when deploying applications to EKS in production, and how do you address them?

Common challenges and solutions:

  * **Challenge: Cluster autoscaling issues** (e.g., pods stuck in Pending).
      * **Solution:** Use **Cluster Autoscaler** to scale node groups based on pod demand. Configure **Pod Disruption Budgets (PDBs)** to ensure availability.
  * **Challenge: Networking misconfigurations** (e.g., ALB not routing to pods).
      * **Solution:** Validate Ingress annotations, security groups, and VPC CNI settings. Use `kubectl logs` on the ALB Ingress Controller.
  * **Challenge: Secret management** (e.g., exposing sensitive data).
      * **Solution:** Use **Secrets Manager with IRSA** to securely inject secrets into pods.
  * **Challenge: Downtime during deployments.**
      * **Solution:** Implement blue-green or canary deployments and use readiness probes.
  * **Challenge: Monitoring and debugging.**
      * **Solution:** Integrate **Prometheus/Grafana** for metrics and **CloudWatch** for logs.

**Key Points:**

  * **Effective autoscaling strategies**
  * **Thorough networking validation**
  * **Robust secrets management**
  * **Achieving zero-downtime deployments**
  * **Comprehensive observability setup**

## End-to-End Request Flow (Detailed)

Here’s a detailed breakdown of a user request flow from hitting the ALB to reaching the application endpoint:

1.  **User Request:**

      * A user sends an HTTPS request to `https://app.example.com/api`.
      * The domain resolves via Route 53 to the ALB’s DNS name.

2.  **Route 53:**

      * Hosted zone in Route 53 maps `app.example.com` to the ALB’s DNS (e.g., `alb-123456.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com`).

3.  **Application Load Balancer (ALB):**

      * The ALB listens on port 443 (HTTPS) with an **ACM certificate** for TLS termination.
      * Listener rules evaluate the request path (e.g., `/api`) and route to a target group.
      * The target group is configured by the **ALB Ingress Controller** to point to EKS worker nodes or pod IPs.

4.  **EKS Cluster:**

      * **Worker Nodes:** The request reaches a worker node (EC2 or Fargate) via a `NodePort` (if using Service type `NodePort`) or pod IP (if using AWS VPC CNI).
      * **Kube-Proxy:** Routes the request to a Kubernetes Service (type `ClusterIP`), which load-balances to application pods.
      * **Ingress Controller:** The AWS ALB Ingress Controller (running as a pod) syncs the ALB’s target group with the Service and pod IPs.

5.  **Kubernetes Service:**

      * The `Service` selects pods based on labels (e.g., `app: my-app`).
      * Routes traffic to a healthy pod (based on readiness probes).

6.  **Application Pod:**

      * The pod runs the application container (e.g., a Node.js app).
      * Processes the request and returns a response (e.g., JSON data).

7.  **Response Path:**

      * The response travels back through the `Service`, `kube-proxy`, worker node, ALB, and to the user.

8.  **Monitoring:**

      * **CloudWatch** logs ALB access logs and application logs.
      * **Prometheus/Grafana** (if deployed) monitors pod metrics.

**Services Involved:**

  * Route 53: DNS resolution.
  * ACM: TLS certificate for the ALB.
  * ALB: External load balancing and TLS termination.
  * EKS: Kubernetes cluster hosting the application.
  * ALB Ingress Controller: Syncs ALB with Kubernetes Ingress.
  * CloudWatch: Logs and metrics.
  * Secrets Manager: Stores sensitive data (e.g., certificate ARNs, database credentials).
  * ECR: Stores Docker images for the application.
  * Jenkins: Automates deployment to EKS.
